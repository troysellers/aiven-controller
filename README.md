# Aiven Controller

Stupid simple CLI to start and stop all aiven services in a project. 

Requires a .env file that looks like 

```
PROJECT=<your-project-name>
AUTH_TOKEN=<your-aiven-auth-token>
```

once you have that setup .. simple flag to run

Stop all your services in a project
```
> go run stop.go -stop
```

Start all your services in a project
```
> go run stop.go -start
```

enjoy.
